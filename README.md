🧠 ICDS AI Toolkit – Child Risk Assessment Dashboard

A Power BI–based analytical dashboard designed to identify, monitor, and assess child risk levels and dropout probability across villages under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) framework.

This project transforms raw child-level data into actionable insights to support early intervention, policy planning, and data-driven decision-making.

📌 Project Overview

The ICDS AI Toolkit – Child Risk Assessment Dashboard provides a centralized view of child well-being indicators such as:

Risk Level (Safe, Warning, Critical)

Dropout Risk

Village-wise critical distribution

Gender-based analysis

Geo-spatial risk mapping

AI-generated analytical insights

The dashboard is built using Microsoft Power BI, leveraging Power Query, DAX, and data modeling best practices.

🎯 Objectives

Identify children at high risk early

Monitor village-wise critical cases

Analyze dropout risk patterns

Enable targeted intervention planning

Improve transparency in ICDS monitoring

🗂️ Data Source

Format: Excel (.xlsx)

Level: Child-level records

Key Fields:

Child ID

Age

Gender

Village

Enrollment / Update Status

Health & Risk Indicators

🔄 Data Processing & Cleaning

All data preparation was performed using Power Query Editor in Power BI:

Standardized village and location names

Corrected spelling inconsistencies

Formatted date columns

Replaced missing and invalid values

Removed duplicates

Ensured correct data types

This ensured data accuracy, consistency, and reliability.

🧱 Data Modeling

Created a structured data model with proper relationships

Implemented a Date Table for time intelligence

Optimized filter flow for accurate aggregations
